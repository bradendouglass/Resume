<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>Dynamic, results oriented individual with over 8 years of technical
based IT work experience and visible achievements in the areas of
technology, social media, and development. In my free time I enjoy
hacking on throw-away code and open source projects, being pushed by
Crossfit and barefoot running, and adore fine beer and real food.
Looking for a position and or a team where I can be slotted into the
very bottom of the &quot;chain&quot;. Aching to have my development skills
stretched, modified, and ultimatly broken. </p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p><strong>Electronic Data Magnetics</strong><br>
Developer
2010 - Current<br>
In-house programmer that was originally brought on to clean up and
complete a viable estimates and order system for customer service
representatives. A working and viable prototype was completed in
FileMaker 11 and implemented. A much more concise project re-write is
currently in the process using Ruby and the Rails framework. Other
completed projects include: web presence redesign, inventory - job
costing internal applications, and knowledge forums
to share information across the corporation. When, not pushing text
into Vim, day-to-day responsibilities include solving complex technical problems to aid business operations.</p>

<p><strong>My Untitled Folder</strong><br>
Podcast Co-Host<br>
2008 - 2011<br>
Myself and one co-host produced almost 100 episodes that focused on
Apple, Google, the cloud and any up and coming tech. No one really
listened to the podcast and after 3 years of constructing extensive
weekly show notes, editing out issues in the audio, and trying to
stretch ideas and questions out of the conversation I decided to cut the
chord and pursue independent web media without my co-host. Never a one
regret.</p>

<p><strong>Benedict Advertising / Honkfish Social Media</strong><br>
Community Manager (&quot;Social Media Artificier&quot;)<br>
2009 - 2010<br>
A fledgling social media marketing firm was looking to fill a position with someone who had past experience yet, had a impressive grasp on emerging technology.  Community advocates  plan and implement specific online brand building techniques for a diverse group of clients.  Successful clients and advocates leverage company profiles in order to listen to customer needs, conduct research and development, interact freely with new and emerging customers, build friendships, and improve sales (if sales are the overall focus).</p>

<p><strong>It and Social Media Freelancer</strong><br>
2008 - 2009<br>
Client based work focusing on Social Media Consulting, Web Design, Help desk needs, and more in a Mac (10.4 / 10.5 Server), Linux, Windows (XP / Vista / 7) based network environment.Â  The extra free time has allowed me to further my views into Ruby, Cocoa, PHP and other aspects of coding and web development.</p>

<p><strong>Miller School of Albemarle</strong><br>
IT Director<br>
2006 - 2008<br>
Complete control over the technological needs of The Miller School (private: grades 8-12). Projects I undertook included, wireless networking for teachers, faculty laptops / desktop upkeep, technology education programs for faculty and staff, web application integration, Novel-Linux / MAC / Microsoft integration, wired / wireless 802.11 a/g/b/n networking and implementation (Cisco / 3Com / Proxim), lab construction, web site design (CSS, PHP, jQuery, Photoshop, Illustrator) / upkeep, successful year to year budgeting, and new hardware/software/security research and integration (VMware).
Help Desk Supervisor, Guilford College Greensboro, North Carolina 2003-2006
We (I and several others) took a wavering college help desk and brought it back into the 21st century and gave it a flare and effectiveness required at the collegiate level. Specific program usage include: Windows XP, OS X 10.3/10.4, Linux, Windows Server 2003, Print Manager Plus, Active Directory and more.</p>

<p><strong>Douglass Sand and Gravel</strong><br>
