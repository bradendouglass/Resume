<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>Dynamic, results oriented individual with over 8 years of technical based IT work experience and visible achievements in the areas of technology, social media, and development. In my free time I enjoy hacking on throw-away code and open source projects, being pushed by Crossfit and barefoot running, and adore fine beer and real food. Looking for a position or a team where I can find a setting for my deverse skill set and build heavily upon my journey as a developer.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p><strong>Legal Bids (Startup)</strong><br>
Full Stack Developer
2012 - Current<br>
Think Legalzoom meets Elance. A marketplace where lawyers can bid on work 
from pre-qualified clients with guarenteed payment through an escrow system.
A small two man team (including myself) built the entirety of the back-end
and front-end of the system. Some of the more specific items that I implemented 
were the escrow payment system, lawyer dashboard, bid processes, and commenting
system.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic Data Magnetics</strong><br>
Developer
2010 - 2012<br>
In-house programmer that was originally brought on to clean up and
complete a viable estimates and order system for customer service
representatives. A working and viable prototype was completed in
FileMaker 11 and implemented. A much more concise project re-write is
currently in the process using Ruby and the Rails framework. Other
completed projects include: web presence redesign, inventory and job
costing internal applications, and knowledge forums
to share information across the corporation. When, not pushing text
into Vim, day-to-day responsibilities include solving complex technical problems to aid business operations.</p>

<p><strong>Benedict Advertising / Honkfish Social Media</strong><br>
Community Advocate (&quot;Social Media Artificier&quot;)<br>
2009 - 2010<br>
A fledgling social media marketing firm was looking to fill a position with someone who had past experience yet, had a impressive grasp on emerging technology.  Community advocates  plan and implement specific online brand building techniques for a diverse group of clients.  Successful clients and advocates leverage company profiles in order to listen to customer needs, conduct research and development, interact freely with new and emerging customers, build friendships, and improve sales.</p>
